### Introduction

2D charts are created with a similar set of components. The most import of these is the ```XY``` series component that allows us to map 2D data to a familiar set of plots.

The ```XY``` series takes the following arguments:

* ```x```: The data series for the first dimension.
* ```y```: The data series for the second dimension.
* ```name```: The name for the series.
* ````type````: The type for the series, which determines how it is rendered.
* ```style```: This specifies the style for the marker.
*  ```xaxis```: This specifies the xaxis that the series maps to.
*  ```yaxis```: This specifies the yaxis that the series maps to.
*  ```marker```: This is a Marker component that sets a range of marker-specific options.
*  ```hist_options```: This is a HistOptions component that sets a range of histogram specific options
*  ```hist2d_options```: This is a Hist2dOptions component that sets 2D histogram specific options.
*  ```xerror```: This specifies the behaviour of the x error bar.
*  ```yerror```: This specifies the behaviour of the y error bar.

### Types of 2D Charts Available

Picta allows many different charts to be composed, but at the base level the following can types of series can be created:

* Scatter
* Bar
* Histogram
* Pie
* 2D Density Histogram


### Composition

The style of creating charts in Picta is grammatical. A user simply has to declare the the various properties and transformations they would like to be applied to the series. Picta tries to avoid casting plots as special cases as much as possible. This allows the API to be simpler, and once you get the hang of it, making charts becomes a very familiar process.

### An Example: Constructing a 2D Density Histogram

In order to demonstrate the above examples, the following example will show how to create a 2D density histogram chart that has multiple axes. A fully exhaustive list of examples for each and every chart type would not be feasible given how customizable charts are.


```scala
interp.repositories() ++= Seq(coursierapi.MavenRepository.of(
    "https://jitpack.io"
))
```

```scala
import $ivy. `org.carbonateresearch::picta:0.1`
```

```scala
import org.carbonateresearch.picta.render.Html.initNotebook
initNotebook()
```

```scala
import org.carbonateresearch.picta._

// import the rest of the items we will need
import org.carbonateresearch.picta.options.histogram.HistOptions
import org.carbonateresearch.picta.options.histogram2d.Hist2dOptions
import org.carbonateresearch.picta.options.HORIZONTAL

import org.carbonateresearch.picta.options.Marker
```

```scala
// create some dummy data
val x = List.range(0, 100).map(x => scala.util.Random.nextDouble() * 50)
val y = List.range(0, 100).map(x => scala.util.Random.nextDouble() * 50)
```

```scala
val marker = Marker() setColor "rgb(102,0,0)"

// in these examples we will use function chaining. This technique allows the IDE to do heavylifting as it can
// do code completion for the user
val series1 = XY(x, y) 
            // here we specify we want a scatter chart
            .asType(SCATTER)
            // this just sets the name of the series; how it will be shown in the legend
            .setName("points")
            // this tells picta to style the data points as markers
            .drawMarkers
            // as we assigned the marker toa value, we can pass it in the setMarker function
            .setMarker(marker)

// we can set the options for the 2D histogram as a seperate value
val hist2d_options = Hist2dOptions(ncontours = 20, reversescale = false, showscale = true)

val series2 = XY(x, y) 
            .setName("density")
            // here we tell Picta how to render the series
            .asType(HISTOGRAM2DCONTOUR)
            // this sets the options
            .setHist2dOptions(hist2d_options)

val series3 = XY(x = x)
            .asType(HISTOGRAM)
            .setName("histogram")
            // this tells picta to plot the series on the first x-axis and the second y-axis
            .setAxes(XAxis(), YAxis(2))

val series4 = (XY(y)
            .setName("y density")
            .asType(HISTOGRAM)
            // we set this to sit on the second x axis we create
            .setAxis(XAxis(2))
            .setMarker(marker)
            // this orientates the density histogram to be horizontal; so it makes sense when plotted
            .setHistOptions(HistOptions(orientation = HORIZONTAL)))

// here we create the individual axes. The domains range from 0.0 to 1, and so we give each axis a proportion
val ax1 = XAxis(showgrid = false) setDomain(0.0, 0.85)
val ax2 = YAxis(showgrid = false) setDomain(0.0, 0.85)
val ax3 = XAxis(position = 2, showgrid = false) setDomain(0.85, 1.0)
val ax4 = YAxis(position = 2, showgrid = false) setDomain(0.85, 1.0)

// here we construct the layout seperately as to demonstrate how it would be done in practice
val layout = (
    ChartLayout("Histogram2dContour With Density", autosize = false, showlegend = false) 
    setAxes(ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4)
)

// here we leverage the Picta dsl to declaratively create the chart. The layout is set like any other value
val chart = Chart() addSeries(series1, series2, series3, series4) setChartLayout layout

chart.plotInline
```

The above code will produce something that looks similar to the below image:
