### Introduction

2D charts are created with a similar set of components. The most import of these is the ```XY``` series component that allows us to map 2D data to a familiar set of plots.

The ```XY``` series takes the following arguments:

* ```x```: The data series for the first dimension.
* ```y```: The data series for the second dimension.
* ```name```: The name for the series.
* ````type````: The type for the series, which determines how it is rendered.
* ```style```: This specifies the style for the marker.
*  ```xaxis```: This specifies the xaxis that the series maps to.
*  ```yaxis```: This specifies the yaxis that the series maps to.
*  ```marker```: This is a Marker component that sets a range of marker-specific options.
*  ```hist_options```: This is a HistOptions component that sets a range of histogram specific options
*  ```hist2d_options```: This is a Hist2dOptions component that sets 2D histogram specific options.
*  ```xerror```: This specifies the behaviour of the x error bar.
*  ```yerror```: This specifies the behaviour of the y error bar.

### Types of 2D Charts Available

Picta allows many different charts to be composed, but at the base level the following can types of series can be created:

* Scatter
* Bar
* Histogram
* Pie
* 2D Density Histogram


### Composition

The style of creating charts in Picta is grammatical. A user simply has to declare the the various properties and transformations they would like to be applied to the series. Picta tries to avoid casting plots as special cases as much as possible. This allows the API to be simpler, and once you get the hang of it, making charts becomes a very familiar process.

### An Example: Constructing a 2D Density Histogram

In order to demonstrate the above examples, the following example will show how to create a 2D density histogram chart that has multiple axes. A fully exhaustive list of examples for each and every chart type would not be feasible given how customizable charts are.


```scala
interp.repositories() ++= Seq(coursierapi.MavenRepository.of(
    "https://jitpack.io"
))
```

```scala
import $ivy. `org.carbonateresearch::picta:0.1`

import org.carbonateresearch.picta.render.Html.initNotebook

initNotebook()

import org.carbonateresearch.picta._
import org.carbonateresearch.picta.options.Marker
import org.carbonateresearch.picta.options.histogram.HistOptions
import org.carbonateresearch.picta.options.histogram2d.Hist2dOptions
```

```scala
// create some dummy data
val x = List.range(0, 100).map(x => scala.util.Random.nextDouble() * 50)
val y = List.range(0, 100).map(x => scala.util.Random.nextDouble() * 50)

val marker = Marker() setColor "rgb(102,0,0)"

val series1 = XY(x, y) 
            .asType(SCATTER)
            .drawMarkers
            .setName("points")
            .setMarker(marker)

val hist2d_options = Hist2dOptions(ncontours = 20, reversescale = false, showscale = true)

val series2 = XY(x, y) 
            .setName("density")
            .asType(HISTOGRAM2DCONTOUR)
            .setHist2dOptions(hist2d_options)

val series3 = XY(x = x)
            .asType(HISTOGRAM)
            .setName("histogram")
            .setAxes(XAxis(), YAxis(2))

val series4 = (XY(y)
            .setName("y density")
            .asType(HISTOGRAM)
            .setAxis(XAxis(2))
            .setMarker(marker)
            .setHistOptions(HistOptions(orientation = HORIZONTAL)))

val ax1 = XAxis(showgrid = false) setDomain(0.0, 0.85)
val ax2 = YAxis(showgrid = false) setDomain(0.0, 0.85)
val ax3 = XAxis(position = 2, showgrid = false) setDomain(0.85, 1.0)
val ax4 = YAxis(position = 2, showgrid = false) setDomain(0.85, 1.0)

val layout = (
    ChartLayout("Histogram2dContour With Density", autosize = false, showlegend = false) 
    setAxes(ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4)
)

val chart = Chart() addSeries(series1, series2, series3, series4) setChartLayout layout

chart.plotInline
```

The above code will produce something that looks similar to the below image:
