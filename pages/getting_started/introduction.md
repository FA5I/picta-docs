## Overview

This site provides documentation, training, and other notes for the Picta Graphing Library. The aim is to provide instructive examples that aid understanding how to compose charts using the library.

The instructions here are geared towards technical writers working on documentation. You may have a team of one or more technical writers working on documentation for multiple projects. You can use this same theme to author all of your documentation for each of your products. The theme is built to accommodate documentation for multiple products on the same site.
